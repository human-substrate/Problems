# Data

## Purpose

The Data directory contains curated, ground-truth datasets about important aspects of human life, society, and progress, along with documentation for external data sources. This is a collection of reliable, parseable data that can be used for analysis, research, and informed decision-making.

## 🎯 "Answer First" Schema

**All Substrate datasets follow the "Answer First" schema.** Every dataset has a `SUMMARY.md` file that puts the best estimate at the top.

### Quick Reference

### Schema Structure

Every `SUMMARY.md` follows this structure:

```markdown
# [Dataset Title]: Executive Summary

## 🎯 BEST ESTIMATE

| Metric | Value | Confidence | Last Updated |
|--------|-------|------------|--------------|
| **[Primary Metric]** | **[VALUE]** | [X%] | [DATE] |

**One-liner:** [12 words max - the quotable answer]

**Caveat:** [Single most important limitation]

---

## The Big Picture
[2-3 sentences: What this is, why it matters, major uncertainty]

## Why This Number Matters
[Context for why this metric is important]

## How the Number Is Calculated
[Methodology summary]

## Confidence Assessment
[What we know well vs. what's uncertain]

## Alternative Estimates & Why We Differ
[When applicable: other approaches and why we chose ours]

## Data Sources

### Confidence Level Guidelines

| Level | Percentage | When to Use |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| **Very High** | 95%+ | Official government data, single authoritative source |
| **High** | 85-94% | Multiple corroborating sources, minor definitional variation |
| **Medium** | 65-84% | Extrapolated from good sources, definitional uncertainty |
| **Low** | <65% | Limited data, significant methodological issues |

**Start with SUMMARY.md** in any dataset directory—it gives you the answer first.

## Philosophy

**Answer First**: Every dataset puts the best estimate at the top. Don't make people hunt for the number.

**Ground Truth**: All datasets come from authoritative, verifiable sources. We prioritize data quality and transparency over volume.

**Human-Readable + Machine-Parseable**: Data is stored in CSV and Markdown formats—no opaque databases. Anyone (human or AI) can read, understand, and analyze these datasets with minimal friction.

**Confidence-Aware**: Every estimate includes confidence levels. We distinguish between what we know well (99%+) and what's uncertain (65%).

**Traceable**: Every number links to its authoritative source. Changes are logged with reasons.

---

## Data Quality Standards

### Mandatory Requirements
- **Confidence level** - Every estimate needs uncertainty bounds
- **Last updated** - When data was most recently validated
- **Source links** - Authoritative URLs for verification
- **Changelog** - Track revisions with reasons

### Quality Indicators
- **Accuracy**: Data from verified, authoritative sources
- **Completeness**: Gaps and missing data documented
- **Timeliness**: Update frequency and freshness noted
- **Transparency**: Methodology documented and reproducible

---

## Contributing Datasets

When adding new datasets:

1. **Use the template** - Start with [DATASET-TEMPLATE.md](./DATASET-TEMPLATE.md)
2. **Answer first** - Create SUMMARY.md with 🎯 BEST ESTIMATE at top
3. **Verify sources** - Use authoritative, primary sources
4. **Set confidence** - Use the confidence level guidelines
5. **Document changes** - Include changelog from day one
6. **Link thoroughly** - Every number should trace to a source

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. **Burying the answer** - Never make someone scroll to find the number
2. **No confidence level** - Every estimate needs uncertainty bounds
3. **Stale dates** - Always show when last validated
4. **Methodology before answer** - People want the answer first
5. **No changelog** - Revisions without history erode trust

## Integration with Substrate

Data sources support other Substrate components:

- **Claims** can be backed by datasets with linked evidence
- **Arguments** can reference specific metrics and sources
- **Solutions** can be evaluated using ground-truth indicators
- **Plans** can track progress with authoritative data

---

## Relationship with Research Projects

The Data directory works with `research/` to maintain traceability between research and resulting datasets.

**Research → Data Workflow:**

1. **Input**: Research projects use `Data/sources/` for external APIs
2. **Analysis**: Research performs synthesis and investigation
3. **Output**: Curated datasets stored in `Data/` with SUMMARY.md
4. **Documentation**: Methodology and sources fully documented

**Key Principles:**
- Each dataset includes `source.md` documenting origin
- Research projects document which sources they used
- Bidirectional links maintain complete traceability
- Changes tracked in both research notes and dataset changelogs

---

**Mission**: Build a trusted foundation of ground-truth data to support human understanding and progress.
